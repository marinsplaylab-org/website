      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Marins PlayLab is an independent space for exploring STEM and more through interactive, open projects, visuals, experiments, and discoveries.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a curiosity driven passion project in a very early phase, with a simple goal: make learning feel simple, clear, and fun. The focus is on short educational posts, science news, visual explanations, and small projects you can try yourself, such as simulations that let you explore ideas instead of only reading about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributions are welcome, especially from people with deeper knowledge in specific topics. Some parts of the workflow use AI to speed up development, but everything is reviewed and curated so the final posts and projects stay as accurate and honest as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the aim is to grow the community and this space into a wider collection of topics across science, space, technology, engineering, math, and the broader world of curiosity, including history and other fields that connect to how we understand the universe.
      </p>
      <h2>Open Source and Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        The website and its projects are published openly on
        <a href="https://github.com/marinsplaylab-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
        so people can learn from them, reuse them, and improve them. The site is early stage, so updates will arrive gradually.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        No ads. No aggressive tracking. Only essential services are used to run the site and projects. If a third party service is involved, their policies apply and they handle their own data.
